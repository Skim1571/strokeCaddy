### **_Description_**

#### Creating a golf stroke tracking app. This app will keep track of the player's stroke and club used for that stroke. The user will be able to POST their stroke & used club. The User can also GET a prior game's score / club usage. The user will also be able to Update their score and Delete a recorded game.

### Phase I Complete: The App currently allows users to Create a new course. The user is then able to view all created courses and make changes or delete a course. As this app continues to develop more functionality will allow player strokes to be recorded / updated / deleted.
